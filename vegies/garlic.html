                    <h3>To plant and grow garlic, follow these steps:

                        <br><br>1. Choose a location with well-draining soil and full sun exposure. Garlic prefers a soil pH between 6.0 and 7.0.
                        
                        <br><br>2. Separate the garlic bulbs into individual cloves, and plant each clove about 1-2 inches deep, with the pointed end facing upwards. Space the cloves about 6-8 inches apart, in rows that are about 12-18 inches apart.
                        
                        <br><br>3. Water the garlic regularly, keeping the soil moist but not waterlogged. Mulch the soil around the garlic plants to help retain moisture and suppress weeds.
                        
                        <br><br>4. Fertilize the garlic plants with a balanced fertilizer, such as a 10-10-10 formula, according to the instructions on the packaging.
                        
                        <br><br>5. As the garlic plants grow, weed around them regularly to prevent competition for nutrients and moisture.
                        
                        <br><br>6. When the garlic plants are about 6-8 inches tall, start to hill them up by mounding soil around the base of the plants. This will help to keep the bulbs protected and prevent them from drying out.
                        
                        <br><br>7. Harvest the garlic bulbs when the leaves begin to turn yellow and start to fall over. Carefully dig up the bulbs, and brush off any excess soil.
                        
                        <br><br>8. Cure the garlic bulbs by allowing them to dry in a warm, well-ventilated location for about two weeks. This will help to improve their flavor and extend their shelf life.
                        
                        <br><br>With proper care, your garlic plants should produce bulbs that are ready to harvest in about 7-8 months.<div class="button">
