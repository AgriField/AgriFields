                    <h3>To plant and grow beets, follow these steps:

                        <br><br>1. Choose a location in your garden that gets plenty of sunlight and has well-draining soil. Beets prefer cooler weather, so it's best to plant them in the early spring or late fall.
                        
                        <br><br>2. Before planting, prepare the soil by adding compost or well-rotted manure to improve its fertility and structure. Beets also require a lot of nitrogen, so you may need to add some fertilizer to the soil.
                        
                        <br><br>3. Sow the seeds about Â¼ inch deep and about 2 inches apart in rows that are 12 inches apart. Keep the soil moist but not waterlogged, and thin the seedlings to about 4 inches apart once they have grown to a few inches tall.
                        
                        <br><br>4. As the beet plants grow, keep the soil moist and weed regularly to prevent competition for nutrients and water.
                        
                        <br><br>5. When the beet roots are about the size of a golf ball, carefully thin them to about 4 inches apart to give the remaining plants room to grow.
                        
                        <br><br>6. When the beet roots are about the size of a tennis ball, they are ready to harvest. Gently dig them up with a garden fork, taking care not to damage the roots. Beets are best used fresh, but they can also be stored in the refrigerator for later use.
                        
                        <br><br>With proper care and attention, your beet plants should thrive and produce delicious roots that you can enjoy in a variety of dishes. Good luck with your gardening!</h3>
