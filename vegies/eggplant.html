                    <h3>How to plant Eggplant:
                        <br><br> 1. Start eggplant seeds indoors 6-9 weeks before the last frost is expected. Eggplants need warmth, so it is best to start them indoors and transplant them once the weather is warm enough. Aim to germinate the seeds 6-9 weeks before the last frost of the year is predicted. Eggplants should not be re-planted outdoors until the temperature is at least 70 째F (21 째C).
                        <br><br> 2. Soak the seeds overnight before germinating them. Eggplant seeds have a better chance of growing if they are soaked thoroughly before planting. Place the seeds in a small container and completely cover them with water. Let the seeds sit overnight, then drain the water.
                        <br><br>3. Fill seed trays with a fine, loose growing medium. For the best results, germinate eggplant seeds in a soil-less growing medium. Fill seed trays 3/4 full with the growing medium of your choice. Vermiculite, perlite, coconut husk, and compost are all good options.
                        <br><br> 4. Plant the seeds 0.25 inches (0.64 cm) deep and moisten the medium. Using your fingers, push 1-2 eggplant seeds into the growing medium in each individual seed container. Make sure that the seeds are about 0.25 inches (0.64 cm) under the surface of the growing medium. Cover over the seeds and mist or sprinkle water onto the surface.
                        <br><br> 5. Let the seeds germinate for 5-14 days. Eggplants seeds will grow as soon as 5 days or in as long as 2 weeks, depending on the temperature they are kept at. Warmer temperatures will spur a quicker germination period. Try to maintain a temperature of at least 65 째F (18 째C) for your eggplant seeds while they are germinating.
                        <br><br>6. Transplant the seedlings into pots when they reach 3 inches (7.6 cm) tall. When the seedlings are large enough they should be given their own individual pots. Fill small pots with the same growing medium you used to start the seeds and dig small holes to insert the seedlings. Gently remove each seedling from the growing tray and replant them in their new pots.
